Our main task is to use trained files of some models and run on Jetson Nano.

There are three potential models that we can implement on it.

1st is a Yolov5 trained model that we are using for Object detection. (trained file best.pt is attached)
2nd is an EfficientDet model trained for object detection. (trained model in 2 formats is attached)
3rd is a project on TB detection that performs classification ( report is attached) 

Plz see these models how they work and how these trained files can be run on Jetson Nano.
